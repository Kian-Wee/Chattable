Instead of the Lack table, a larger table was used along with a translucent acrylic sheet to diffuse the LEDs. A hardware pinball layer was also added on top to increase interactivity.

Main menu of this table is divided into 9 sections:
1. Rainbow animation
2. Animations from FastLed library
3. Stars animation
4. VU Meter
5. Dice for games
6. Tetris game
7. Snake game
